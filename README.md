### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was a project for a client aiming to revolutionize driver training and education. The client, Liam, wanted to address the gap in the market concerning training for driving tests at the local DMV. They envisioned an all-encompassing system that would provide online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training to help users pass their driving tests.

### What did you do particularly well?
I was able to capture all client requirements and accurately represent them in UML Diagrams. I created businesss requirement documents and system design documents that aligned with client expectations.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to include more details in my UML diagrams. Clearer visuals can enhance communication and understanding, especially when presenting complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I carefully analyzed the client's vision and understood it from the interview transcript. I interpreted these needs by creating use cases, activity diagrams, and class diagrams that captured the desired functionalities and interactions. Considering user needs is crucial because a well-designed system should cater to users' goals, preferences, and limitations to ensure user satisfaction and system usability.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to designing software involves a thorough understanding of the project's goals and requirements. I start by gathering user needs, creating use cases to outline interactions, and visualizing the system's structure through class diagrams. In the future, I would continue to use techniques like requirement gathering, creating visual diagrams, and iterative design to analyze and design systems effectively. Additionally, I would emphasize regular communication with clients and stakeholders to ensure alignment and address potential issues early in the design process.
